#  Air Quality Index Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents an interactive **Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard** built using Microsoft Power BI to analyze pollution levels across cities and over time.

---

##  Objective

The goal of this dashboard is to visualize air pollution trends and identify the most polluted cities using AQI and pollutant data.
It helps users quickly understand environmental conditions and patterns through visual insights.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

* Top polluted cities comparison
* Year-wise AQI trend analysis
* Pollutant level breakdown (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, etc.)
* Interactive filters for city and date
* Clean and user-friendly visual layout

##  Dataset

The dataset contains air quality measurements such as:

* AQI values
* Pollutant concentrations
* City information
* Date-wise environmental readings

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Power BI**
* **Power Query Editor**
* **DAX (basic measures)**
* **Data Visualization Techniques**

---

##  Insights Derived

* Certain cities consistently show higher AQI levels
* Pollution levels vary significantly across years
* Some pollutants contribute more heavily to AQI trends
* Visual analysis helps identify environmental risk zones

---

##  Conclusion

This dashboard demonstrates how data visualization can help monitor environmental conditions and support decision-making for pollution control and urban planning.
